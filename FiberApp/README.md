# FiberApp
FiberApp is a software for tracking and analyzing biomacromolecules, polymers, filaments and fibrous objects.

The processing algorithms include:
* Height Profile
* Height Autocorrelation function (ACF)
* Height Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
* Height Distribution
* Length Distribution
* Orientation Distribution
* Curvature Distribution
* Kink Angle Distribution
* Bond Correlation Function(BCF)
* Mean-Squared End-to-end Distance (MSED)
* Mean-Squared Midpoint Displacement (MSMD)
* Scaling Exponent
* Excess Kurtosis
* 2D Order Parameter
