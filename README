Each scrapy project is designed to be ran within the folder.

Ex: to run the time_covers spider, go into the
    "Reverse_plot/scrapy_stuff/time_covers" directory and then run
     "scrapy pyimagesearch-cover-spider -o output.json"

The images will be dumped into Reverse_Plot/dump/full and the output file will
be in "Reverse_Plot/scrapy_stuff/time_covers" directory.
